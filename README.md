# Project: Scala Strutturale in Acciaio | Steel Staircase Design

## Overview
Detailed CAD design and structural consideration for a robust industrial/commercial steel staircase. This project showcases the application of standard structural profiles and bracing for stability.

## Key Features
* **Main Structure:** UPE 240 steel stringers and HEA 180 steel columns.
* **Stability:** Integrated angular bracing for lateral load resistance and structural rigidity.
* **Design Focus:** Emphasized structural integrity, manufacturability, and compliance with relevant building standards (e.g., NTC 2018 for Italy, Eurocodes).

## Software & Tools
* **CAD Modeling:** Tekla Structures
* **Analysis (if applicable):**  SAP2000

## Visuals
Here's a perspective view of the staircase structure:
